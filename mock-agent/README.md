# mock-agent

This is a simple mock server that simulates the behavior of a Rancher Agent for development and testing purposes. It listens for WebSocket connections and responds to messages.

The messages are enqueued using http control endpoints, so you can control the responses sent to the connected clients.

## Deprecation Notice
This mock-agent is deprecated.
Please use the LLM Mock Server for testing and development of AI-related features in the Rancher AI UI extension.
